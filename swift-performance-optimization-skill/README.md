# Swift Performance Optimization Skill

This skill provides techniques for optimizing Swift code performance, including memory management, rendering efficiency, and profiling with Instruments.

## Activation

This skill activates automatically for queries related to:
- Swift performance bottlenecks and optimization
- Memory management and leak prevention
- Instruments profiling and analysis
- UI rendering performance improvements
- Efficient data structures and algorithms
- Concurrency and threading optimizations

## Setup

To use this skill effectively:

1. Install Xcode with Instruments (included by default).
2. Familiarize yourself with common profiling instruments: Time Profiler, Allocations, Leaks.
3. Learn ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) concepts.
4. Understand SwiftUI's rendering cycle and state management.

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for sample code and prompts demonstrating performance optimization techniques.
