This skill provides expertise in building declarative user interfaces with SwiftUI, focusing on best practices, SF Symbols integration, and Apple's design guidelines.

## Activation

This skill activates automatically for queries related to:
- SwiftUI development and syntax
- Declarative UI building
- SF Symbols usage and customization
- SwiftUI component creation and state management

## Setup

To use this skill effectively:

1. Ensure you have Xcode 12 or later installed, as SwiftUI requires iOS 13+ or macOS 10.15+.
2. Familiarize yourself with SwiftUI's declarative syntax and property wrappers like `@State`, `@ObservedObject`, and `@EnvironmentObject`.
3. Review Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for design consistency.
