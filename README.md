## How It Works

Once installed, skills activate automatically based on your queries:

- Ask about **SwiftUI** â†’ `swiftui-programming-skill` loads
- Mention **memory leaks** â†’ `memory-leak-diagnosis-skill` activates
- Discuss **accessibility** â†’ `ios-accessibility-skill` engages
- Talk about **testing** â†’ `swift-unit-testing-skill` helps

No manual loading required. Just ask your question and the relevant skills provide expertise.

### Example Usage

```
You: "How do I add VoiceOver labels to my SwiftUI view?"
Claude: [ios-accessibility-skill activates] Here's how to implement VoiceOver...

You: "My app is using too much memory"
Claude: [memory-leak-diagnosis-skill activates] Let's diagnose potential memory leaks...

You: "I need to create a smooth animation"
Claude: [ios-animation-graphics-skill activates] I'll show you SwiftUI animation techniques...
```

Each skill provides:
- Best practices specific to the domain
- Complete, tested code examples
- Modern Swift/iOS patterns (Swift 6, iOS 18+)
- Apple HIG compliance
