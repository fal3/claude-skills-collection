# Cross-Platform App Development Skill

This skill provides strategies for building apps that work seamlessly across Apple's platforms: iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, with a focus on adaptive layouts and multi-view implementations.

## Activation

This skill activates automatically for queries related to:
- Cross-platform app development with SwiftUI
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- Platform-specific implementations
- Multi-device compatibility
- SwiftUI environment usage for platform detection

## Setup

To use this skill effectively:

1. Use Xcode 12+ for full SwiftUI cross-platform support.
2. Set up your project with multiple platform targets when needed.
3. Familiarize yourself with SwiftUI's environment values and size classes.
4. Test on multiple devices/simulators regularly.

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for sample code and prompts demonstrating cross-platform development techniques.
