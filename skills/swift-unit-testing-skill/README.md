This skill provides guidelines and templates for writing effective unit tests with XCTest, covering test-driven development, mocking techniques, and best practices for iOS app testing.

## Activation

This skill activates automatically for queries related to:
- XCTest framework usage
- Unit testing Swift code
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Mocking and dependency injection

- Performance and UI testing

## Setup

To use this skill effectively:

1. Create a test target in your Xcode project (File > New > Target > Unit Testing Bundle).
2. Import your app module with `@testable import YourAppName`.
3. Use descriptive test method names starting with `test`.
4. Structure tests with Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
